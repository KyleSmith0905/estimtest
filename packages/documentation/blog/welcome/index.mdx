# Welcome

This marks the release of Estimtest documentation. I plan to keep this updated with all major changes and releases.

## Next Steps

I plan on growing the number of disabilities covered. Consequently, app using Estimtest would grow in their supported user base.

I am also considering making the UI customizable. Currently I expose a lot of the API methods for modifying with Estimtest; however, I have not documented it.

I should also work on solutions to Estimtest that will not increase bundle size. Thoughts to reduce increased bundle size is: CLI commands, and conditional loading. [The examples I created](https://github.com/KyleSmith0905/estimtest/tree/main/examples) shows Estimtest only being imported when an Estimtest flag is set. However, those examples are sloppy solutions to the problem.

## The Documentation

The documentation was developed with Docusaurus. I added the Estimtest component as a demo. Obviously, the Estimtest should be set to inactive during production release.

My goal behind Estimtest was to keep it simple, yet very customizable. The documentation shows a great example of how I accomplished this. By default, the app works with everything you want it. However, if something fails to workout, it is extremely easy to make it work out.

For example, Estimtest requires itself to be placed in certain positions; however, I reveal an attribute that allows Estimtest to move itself.
