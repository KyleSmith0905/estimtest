All examples should have minimal editing applied from the default "getting started" app; the only thing changed should be related to adding Estimtest to the app. Unless specified the all scrips will not have Estimtest active.

| Tools | Build Size Increase[^1] |
|---|---|
| Angular | n/a |
| Next JS | n/a |
| Vite React | n/a |
| Vite Vue | 112 Bytes |
